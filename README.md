FLASK-MEGA

What is it?
-----------
This is my attempt at following the "Flask Mega Tutorial" outlined by Miguel Grinberg at:

Why?
-----------
The idea of a "micro framework" is appealing and, once I complete the tutorial, I'd like to see if I can use Flask to build some basic websites as coding and configuration exercises/demos (combined with Chef).
